## Background

- MealMate is a web-based food ordering system built using the MERN stack, designed to streamline the process of ordering and managing meals. The platform offers an intuitive interface where users can browse menus, choose their preferred meal plans, and customize their orders. Powered by Node.js and Express.js, the back-end ensures fast order processing and secure transactions, while MongoDB stores user data and order history. With a responsive front-end built in React, MealMate provides a seamless, user-friendly experience for selecting meals, entering delivery details, and completing payments. Whether for one-time orders or subscriptions, FoodieHub makes food delivery quick and easy.

## Entity Relationship Diagrams (ERD)

Entity relationship diagrams (ERDs) are a way to describe the data that will be used in an application. Using the user stories we created above, we know we must keep track of users and listings.

**For users, we need to keep track of:**

1. Username - String, required and unique
2. Email - String, required and unique
3. Password - String, required
4. Account type - enum (admin, user), default: user

**For Subscription, we need to keep track of:**

1. StartDate - Date, required
2. Duration - Number (in months), required
3. MealsPerDay - Enum (2 or 3), required
4. Price - Number, required
5. Preferences - Array (List of Strings)

**For MealPlan, we need to keep track of:**

1. Name - String, required
2. Description - String
3. Dishes - Array (List of Strings)

**For Delivery, we need to keep track of:**

1. Delivery Date - Date, required
2. Status - Enum (Pending, Delivered), required
3. Location - String, required
4. Meals - Array (List of Strings)
